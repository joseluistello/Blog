### About ðŸš€

Identifying problems, creating solutions, and getting sh*t done is the best part of my life. I have experience building, selling, managing, and analyzing projects in different industries for +3 years. 

I consider myself a problem solver with systematic thinking who have a genuine passion for helping business and people. My background and experience in different companies, industries, and technology make me possible to understand the complexity behind physical and digital systems, processes, and business. 

### Enthusiasm ðŸ’“

Iâ€™ve always been passionate about helping others and my interests include writing, community building, creating content, financial modeling, software development, and data analysis. 

Want to know more? I love systems, operations, processes, and strategy. Trying to understand a company from a **systematic and strategic** approach is one of the things I enjoy the most. I'm fascinated by the process of **abstracting physical phenomena** to the digital world so I consider that my experience and the constant effort I make to learn new disciplines have been key to understanding the complexity that exists within organizations, the systems that make them up, each process that exists within them and the strategies applied within the grand scheme.  

### Hobbies ðŸ’¡ 

I have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshLQ0sIzkzHlhnlZN8kiVw) where I solve technical interview problems with SQL and Python. Also, I created [Simplificando la complejidad](https://simplificandola.substack.com/), a newsletter that helps me share what I learn about life and my interests, and I co-lead Develotron, a community focused on software engineering and professional growth.
